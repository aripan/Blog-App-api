    "content": "Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. \n\nA more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, Web development usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. \n\nFor larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.",

    "content": "The most beautiful programming language in the world is useless unless it allows you to write the program that you need. In the area of graphical user interfaces, JavaScript benefits from being part of HTML5. There are more technologies than just HTML5 that complement JavaScript and make the language more useful: \n\nLibraries \nJavaScript has an abundance of libraries, which enables to complete tasks ranging from parsing JavaScript (via Esprima) to processing and displaying PDF files (via PDF.js). \n\nNode.js \nThe Node.js platform lets you write server-side code and shell scripts (build tools, test runners, etc.). \n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) \nJSON is a data format rooted in JavaScript that has become popular for exchanging data on the Web (e.g., the results of web services). \n\nNoSQL databases (such as CouchDB and MongoDB) \nThese databases tightly integrate JSON and JavaScript. \n\nJavaScript is getting better build tools (e.g., Grunt) and test tools (e.g., mocha). Node.js makes it possible to run these kinds of tools via a shell (and not only in the browser).",

    "title": "Why coding is important?",
    "content": "Nowadays with everything being electronic, everything needs to be programmed! Without coding, computers would literally do nothing. They would be completely useless. From computers, to cars, machines, or anything else most likely requires programming! That’s because source code is the set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Computers have no free will, after all, so without explicit instruction, they’re just sophisticated hunks of metal. \n\nNow think of all the services you use that don’t require interfacing with a computer. Well, chances are they’re still powered by software in one way or another. Honestly, it would be harder to think of things we use today that don’t rely on software in one form or another. Mobile apps, cloud computing, robotics, big data, and the Internet of things have rapidly changed the way people live their lives and do business. New technologies will only continue to do so in the future. So as a result, demand for coders keeps increasing year by year, due to all these technological advances!",
